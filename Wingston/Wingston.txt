Problem Statement:

To accurately predict the future closing value of a given stock across a given period of time in the future

About The Idea:

Traditional machine learning models have a poor historical record in financial predictions due to their inability to learn new patterns
on the data implicitly.

We have improved upon this idea and conceived a Recurrent Neural Network which can intelligently learn upon new patterns and ideas without 
any external stimulus.

It constantly feeds it's results in itself to generate a better outcome based on slight principles of Reinforcement Learning

Upon using various datasets the model will surely yield promising results with low bias and low variance


Tech Stack:

Python , Machine Learning , Tensorflow , Keras

Implementation:

We have used the Tensorflow library of Deep Learning to develop a model with Recurrent layers whose performance has been enhanced using Hyperparameter optimization using the specifiv library Keras Tuner.

The model needs to be fed a variety of Data initially, for training purposes and after some cross-validation the model began to learn a geometric rate
